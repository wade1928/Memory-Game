# Ryan's Memory Game

## Instructions

This is a simple memory matching game.  If two cards are opened that match, the cards are no longer accessible.  If the two cards you open do not match, the cards 'close' and you continue with your life (See! Very simple).  When are cards are matched, a modal displays showing you your score and how many stars you earned.  The score is based on the time it takes to match all cards along with the number of moves.  Opening two cards counts as 1 move.  The number of stars is  based on number of moves you make.  

To play, just go to https://wade1928.github.io/Memory-Game/.  The timer starts as soon as the first card is clicked. Good luck!


## Future Enhancements

Currently, the score only decrements by 10.  Don't worry though, a future enhance will make the scoring system a lot more dynamic.  Also in the future, high scores will be displayed and kept in local storage until you decide to get rid of them.
